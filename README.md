## Environment Setup & How to Install the Project

1. Create a GitHub project repository with a default `README.md.`

2. Clone your repo down to your machine. 

3. Open your project folder in VS Code (if you haven't already).

4. Add a .gitignore with `.vsode/` and `.venv/` and whatever else doesn't need to go in the repo.

5. Create and activate a local virtual environment in `.venv.`
    - `python -m venv .venv`
    - `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

6. Install your dependencies into your `.venv` (pandas and pyarrow) and freeze into your requirements.txt.
    - `pip install pandas pyarrow`
    - `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

7. Record the commands used in your `README.md.`

8. Git add and commit with a useful message (e.g. "initial commit") and push to GitHub.
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "initial commit"`
    - `git push origin main`
